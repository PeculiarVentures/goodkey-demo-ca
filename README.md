# GoodKey Demo CA

This is a demo Certificate Authority (CA) interface for easy digital certificate
issuance and management based on Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs). It's built
with React and TypeScript, and uses the

The application allows you to:

- Issue a certificate based on a CSR
- View details of a certificate
